        <h2> welcome high potential</h2>
        <hr>
        <span>I got knots all up in my chest (Up in my chest, up in my chest)
Just know I'm trying my best (I'm trying my best)
'Cause when you look (When you look)
When you laugh (When you laugh)
When you smile (When you smile)
I'll bring you back (Bring you back)
And now I'm sad (Now I'm sad)
And I'm a mess (And I'm a mess)
And now we high (Now we high)
That's why I left (why I left)
That's why I left
Will your tongue still remember the taste of my lips?
(My lips, my lips, my lips)
Will your shadow remember the swing of my hips?
(My hips, my hips, my hips)
Will your lover caress you the way that I did? (I did, I did, I did)
Will you notice my charm if he slips up one bit? (One bit)
'Cause I don't need to know
I just wanna make sure you're okay (Okay)
I don't need to know
I just wanna make sure you're all safe
All safe, all safe
Will he play you those songs just the way that I did? (I did)
Will he play you so strong just the way that I did? (I did)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Will he treat you like shit just the way that I did? (I did)
'Cause I don't blame ya
'Cause I don't need to know
I just want to make sure you're okay (Okay)
I don't need to know
I just want to make sure you're all safe </span>
